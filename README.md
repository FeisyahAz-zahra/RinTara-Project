#  ℹ About 
RinTara is an educational app that focuses on the history and culture of Indonesia. This application offers a wealth of information on historical and cultural topics that are accessible for reading. Through RinTara, our goal is to preserve Indonesia's diverse historical and cultural heritage amidst the risks posed by the forgetting of traditional cultures due to globalization and modernization. We aim to raise public awareness about the importance of continually preserving the diverse cultures of Indonesia. RinTara is committed to ensuring that the rich cultural heritage of Indonesia can be passed down and appreciated by future generations.

# 💡 Background
In the continually evolving digital era, information technology plays a critical role in various fields, including the education of history and culture. However, the rapid pace of this development often leads society to forget the values of Indonesian history and culture. Additionally, many online educational resources still fail to provide inclusive access.

With RinTara, we strive to enrich the public's knowledge about the nation's cultural wealth and ensure that every individual, without exception, can access and appreciate the cultural heritage of Indonesia.
